# Lost and Found Android Application

## Made using:
	Kotiln
	Jetpack Compose
	Material UI
	Firebase

## Features

	* Post for a lost item.
	* Clain a lost item.
	* Verification of claims.
	* Image upload supported.
	* Profile creation and customization.

## Performance Improvements 

* The application now utilizes fragments instead of multiple activities, which decreases the resource consumption.
* A template image will be loaded in the Lazy-list first till the actual image is downloaded.
* Used stack to keep track of visited fragments, so pressing back will now follow history of visited fragments.
